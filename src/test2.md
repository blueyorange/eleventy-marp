## 6.1.1 Capacitors

1. capacitance $C=\frac{Q}{V}$; the farad

2. charging and discharging of a capacitor or capacitor plates with reference to the flow of electrons

3. total capacitance of two or more capacitors in series; $\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}$

4. total capacitance of two or more capacitors in parallel $C=C_1+C_2$

5. analysis of circuits containing capacitors and resistors; techniques and procedures used to investigate capacitors in both series and parallel combinations using ammeters and voltmeters.

# What is a capacitor?

- two parallel conducting plates
- separated by **vacuum** or an **insulator** (also called a **dielectric**)
- capacitors store **energy** through the separation of electric **charge**

---

# Where are they used?

## Capacitors are used for...

- tuning and filtering signals
- timing
- storing energy (e.g. camera flash, motor starter)
- smoothing and voltage regulation

---

# Capacitance

- The greater the **charge** on capacitor plates, the greater the **potential difference**.
- Potential difference is **directly proportional** to the charged stored

## Definition: capacitance

> **Capacitance** is the ratio of charge to potential difference.

---

# The farad

- the unit of capacitance is called the **farad**.

## Definition: the farad

> One farad is equal to one coulomb per volt.

One farad is quite a large capacitance. It is normal for capacitance to be measured in microfarads or picofarads.

---

# Charging and discharging

- A capacitor is charged by connecting it to a source of potential difference e.g. a cell.
- Current flows in one direction to charge the capacitor, and the opposite direction to discharge.
